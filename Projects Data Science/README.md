# Project Data Science

## Course

The goal of this module is to provide students with a hands-on experience on a novel data-science/AI challenge using state-of-the-art tools and techniques discussed during other classes of this master. Students enrolled in this class will form groups and choose one topic among a list of proposed topics in the core areas of the master such as supervised or unsupervised learning, recommendation, game AI, distributed or parallel data-science, etc. The topics will generally consist in applying a well-established technique on a novel data-science challenge or in applying recent research results on a classical data-science challenge. Either way, each topic will come with its own novel scientific challenge to address. At the end of the module, the students will give an oral presentation to demonstrate their methodology and their findings. Strong scientific rigor as well as very good engineering and communication skills will be necessary to complete this module successfully.

## Projects

This course focuses on projects in group of three-four students. My co-workers were Clément Chauvet and Mathilde Da Cruz.

The two projects are:

- Adversarial Attacks: the goal is to try several adversarial attacks on CIFAR10 data and then try to do adversarial training.
- Graph Neural Networks: trying to reproduce experimentation from a paper, present the paper and give a constructive criticism.
