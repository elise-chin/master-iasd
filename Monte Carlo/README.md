# Monte Carlo

## Course

Introduction to Monte Carlo for computer games. Monte Carlo Search has revolutionized computer games. It works well with Deep Learning so as to create systems that have superhuman performances in games such as Go, Chess, Hex or Shogi. It is also appropriate to address difficult optimization problems. In this course we will present different Monte Carlo search algorithms such as UCT, GRAVE, Nested Monte Carlo and Playout Policy Adaptation. We will also see how to combine Monte Carlo Search and Deep Learning. The validation of the course is a project involving a game or an optimization problem.

## Project

The goal of the project is to apply Monte Carlo search algorithms to the board game Marrakech.
This project was done in collaboration with Mathilde Da Cruz.
