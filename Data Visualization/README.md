# Data Visualization

## Course

The Data Visualisation course has been taught by Criteo. It aims to get an overview of the data visualisation history and focuses on python visualisation's libraries such as Matplotlib, Searborn, Bokeh. It also deals with word similarities and word visualisation through TSNE, PCA and UMAP.

## Project

The goal of the project is to produce data visualizations on a dataset of our choice. With Mathilde Da Cruz, we chose to analyze the [World Happiness Report dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathurinache/world-happiness-report/code?datasetId=748584&sortBy=voteCount). The visualizations were created with plotly and integrated in a Streamlit app.

Usage:

    python -m streamlit run app.py
