# Fundamentals of Machine Learning

## Course

The aim of this course is to provide the students with the fundamental concepts and tools for developing and analyzing machine learning algorithms.
The course will introduce the theoretical foundations of machine learning, review the most successful algorithms with their theoretical guarantees, and discuss their application in real world problems. The covered topics are:
- Introduction to the different paradigms of ML and applications
- Computational learning theory
- PAC model
- VC-dimension
- Rademacher complexity
- Supervised learning
- Logistic regression and beyond
- Perceptron
- SVM
- Kernel methods
- Decision trees and Random Forests
- Ensemble methods: bagging and boosting
- Unsupervised learning
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, ICA, Random Projections, Kernel PCA, ISOMAP, LLE
- Density estimation
- EM
- Spectral clustering
- Online learning
- Multiclass and ranking algorithms

## Project

The final exam is composed of a written exam focusing on supervised learning and a project focusing on unsupervised learning. 

The project consists of three exercises each from the following types:
1. Implement a simple ML method from scratch
    - Implementing k-means clustering algorithm
    - Using PCA as a special form of regression for predicting data features from the others
2. Exploratory analysis of a dataset
    - Analysis of a clinical dataset
3. Derivation of a theoritical results
    - Demonstrate that the matrix of scalar products can be derived from the distance matrix via double-centering, in the case of Euclidean distance

This project was done in collaboration with Mathilde Da Cruz.
