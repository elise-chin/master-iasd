# Deep Learning for Images

## Course

This [course](https://github.com/criteo-research/master-iasd) has been teached by Criteo researchers.

Deep learning has achieved formidable results in the image analysis field in recent years, in many cases exceeding human performance. This success opens paths for new applications, entrepreneurship and research, while making the field very competitive. This course aims at providing the students with the theoretical and practical basis for understanding and using deep learning for image analysis applications. The course will be composed of lectures and practical sessions. Moreover, experts from industry will present practical applications of deep learning.

Lectures will include:
- Introduction to machine learning
- Artificial neural networks, back-propagation algorithm
- Convolutional neural network
- Design and optimization of a neural architecture
- Successful architectures (AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet)
- Analysis of neural network function
- Image classification and segmentation
- Auto-encoders and generative networks
- Current research trends and perspectives

During the practical sessions, the students will code in Python, using Keras and Tensorflow. They will be confronted with the practical problems linked to deep learning: architecture design; optimization schemes and hyper-parameter selection; analysis of results.

## Project

The goal of your project will be to implement and evaluate an adversarial attack system in the domain of face identification, in a closed-set context (i.e. we will not evaluate the models on a 'test' dataset).

This project was done in collaboration with Mathilde Da Cruz.
